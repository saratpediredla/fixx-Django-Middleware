In order for this middleware to work correctly, you will need the following parameters to be set in your settings.py.
    
FIXX_URL : Base URL of your fixx installation without the 'http://' and trailing slash. Ex. example.com:9000 or fixx.mydomain.com:9000
FIXX_USER : Username of account used to log the issue
FIXX_PASSWORD : Password of the account used to log the issue
FIXX_DEFAULT_AREA : The id for default area to log issues to
    
Finally, you need to add this middleware to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings.py
